For years, TextMate was my trusted editor. However, due to its unmaintained status, I’ve tried switching to other editors like Atom, but unfortunately, Microsoft abandoned it in favor of VS Code, which I’m not interested in using. I genuinely desire a text editor.

Recently, I stumbled upon Zed ([https://zed.dev](https://zed.dev)) and, after installing it and merely 1.5 hours fiddling, I was hooked. It’s like “TextMate The Next Generation.”

This repository contains my settings and more, which initially aim to replicate my TextMate experience as closely as possible to facilitate a smooth transition. 😇
